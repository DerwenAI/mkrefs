# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **MkRefs** ðŸŽ‰ 

This page gives a quick overview of how things are organized and most
importantly, how to get involved.


## Issues and bug reports

First, if you want to report a potential issue with this library, please
[do a quick search](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/issues)
to see if the issue has already been reported.
If so, it's best to simply leave a comment on an existing issue,
rather than create a new one.
Older issues may also include helpful info and show solutions to
commonly encountered questions.


## Opening new issues

When opening a 
[new issue](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/issues/new/choose),
please use a **descriptive title** and include information about your
**environment** and library **installation**:

  * Which operating system and version number?
  * Which version of Python?
  * How did you install? `pip`, `conda`, clone repo then `setup.py`, etc.

Try to provide as many details as possible.
What exactly is going wrong?
_How_ is it failing?
Is there an error?

Please understand that in general our developer community does not
provide support via email, Twitter DMs, and other 1:1 messaging.
We believe that help is much more valuable when it gets **shared
publicly**, so that more people can benefit.


## Code of conduct

In all communications and collaborations, we adhere to the
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md).
By participating, you are expected to follow this code.


## Developer community

If you'd like to contribute to this open source project, the best way
to get involved with our developer community is to participate in our
[public office hours](https://www.notion.so/KG-Community-Events-Calendar-8aacbe22efa94d9b8b39b7288e22c2d3)
events.
First join the 
[*Graph-Based Data Science*](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6725785/)
group on LinkedIn where these meetingsget announced.
We'll also have other developer discussions on that forum, along with
related updates, news, conference coupons, etc.

The
[Knowledge Graph Conference](https://derwen.ai/docs/kgl/glossary/#knowledge-graph-conference)
hosts several community resources where you can post questions and get
help about **MkRefs** and related topics.
Many of our developers are involved there too:

  * [community Slack](https://knowledgegraphconf.slack.com/ssb/redirect) â€“ specifically on the `#ask` channel

  * [Knowledge Tech Q&A site](https://answers.knowledgegraph.tech/) for extended questions posed to experts


## Contributing to the code base

You don't have to be an expert to contribute, and we're happy to help
you get started.
We'll try to use the
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/labels/good%20first%20issue)
tags to mark bugs and feature requests that are easy and self-contained.

If you've decided to take on one of these problems, it's best to
[fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks)
and do development and testing in your own fork first.

Please follow the conventions for code formatting, type annotations,
unit tests, code linting, naming conventions, and so on.
Understand that we will not be able to accept pull requests that make
*major overhauls* of the code base or completely change our shared
work on formatting, testing, etc.

If you need to incorporate other libraries, please discuss this with
the other developers.
There may be issues regarding point releases and compatibility that
would have impact on other parts of the code base.

Once you're making good progress, don't forget to add a quick comment
to the original issue.
You can also use the issue to ask questions, or share your work in
progress.
Then when you're ready to submit code for review, please use a 
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
on our `main` repo branch.


## Project roadmap

The
["Graph-Based Data Science"](https://derwen.ai/s/kcgh)
talk describes the **MkRefs** open source project in much more detail,
and discusses some about our roadmap.
In other words, what new features and integrations are we working toward?

See also our:

  * [Project Board](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/projects/1)
  * [Milestones](https://github.com/DerwenAI/mkrefs/milestones)

Suggestions and contributions for our documentation and tutorial are
always welcomed.
These tend to be good starting points for new contributors: you'll get
familiar with our code samples and other resources through that.

Many thanks!
